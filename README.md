### Question to Answer :
* #### Is there a conflict of interest for a website that both sells movie tickets and display review ratings ?

To understand the context of this question..

Let's go ahead and travel all the way back in time to the year 2015.

So it's the year 2015, and you're looking for something to do on a Saturday night and you decide to go see a movie.
 
Now, luckily for you, instead of having to drive all the way to the movie theater and buy your ticket for a show that's happening later that night, there's a website called Fandango, and Fandango sells movie tickets online.

However, you don't actually know what movie you want to watch yet, but luckily for you, Fandango also displays movie ratings.

So they both sell movie tickets and they're displaying movie ratings on the same website.

So you're browsing the Fandango website saying what movies should buy tickets for on their site.

And keep in mind, Fandango is going to have a surcharge on top of the ticket price to make some money off this transaction, which is fair enough, since they're providing a service of selling tickets online.

So you take a look at the Fandango website and you see that taken 3 has a four and a half star rating on Fandango, and this is based off of real data from what their site looked like in 2015.

So to say the least, you go out, you buy the ticket on Fandango and you watch Taken 3 and you may have been disappointed by the film.

And if you want a little more background on why this is, you can go ahead and just Google search taken 3 fence jump scene to get an idea of what the film is like.

So you begin to ask yourself, is there a conflict of interest for a website that is both selling movie tickets and displaying review ratings?

Can I answer this with a data analysis?

Well, for one thing, it should be noted that it probably doesn't bode well for Fandango when their Wikipedia article literally has a controversy section for what should be a pretty simple business of just selling tickets online.

So for this capstone project, we're actually basing this off of a fantastic article that came out in 2015 called Be Suspicious of Online Movie Ratings, especially Fandango, which came from the website [fivethirtyeight.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/)

So the question we were trying to answer was, is there a conflict of interest for a website that is both selling movie tickets and displaying review ratings?

More specifically, really what we're asking is does a website like Fandango artificially display higher review ratings in order to sell more movie tickets?

So recall that in the machine learning pathway, what we have here is a data analysis problem.

We need to collect, clean and organize data and perform exploratory data analysis in order to create some sort of report or visualization to answer this quick question.

And so what are we doing is we would have already scraped some reviews off of many websites for you, and then you'll be using pandas to organize and use Seaborn to explore.

So after use pandas to organize the data, reformat it, and seaborn to visualize and explore it, you should be able to answer the question Does Fandango display artificially higher than average reviews?

Now there's a couple of things to notice before we actually jump to the project and do an overview of the project.

Is that Fandango, interestingly enough, has two ratings.

It has a stars attribute and then a rating attribute.

And stars is the rating that in stars that go from 0 to 5 that's actually displayed on their website HTML And this is what someone would see if they just visited the Fandango website.

But then there's an actual rating, which is the true rating that Fandango holds for that movie.

So what that means is they may be showing someone a four-and-a-half-star visual rating when they fill up the star meter.

But in the background, maybe it's just a 4.3 that they happen to round up.

So first, what we're going to do is we're actually going to compare the true numerical ratings thatFandango holds on its back end against what it actually displays the users.

And then we'll see if there's any discrepancies there.

Then what we're going to do is compare Fandango ratings to other rating websites such as Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic, and see if there is a skew towards rating movies with higher ratings.

And your first task, I would hope, is that you actually read the article.
